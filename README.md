# BUAir_CS411_Project

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, getting flights to travel back home have become increasingly limited as well as expensive, espeically for students at BU. Our group looks to tackle that problem by creating our own airline system known as BUAir. BUAir is a student only airline reservation system which assists students in booking flights from Boston to their homes for the best prices.
